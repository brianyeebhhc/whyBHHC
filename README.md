# whyBHHC

This is a project given by BHHC on "why would I like to be a part of BHHC". The stack I used was primarily css(bootstrap) and jquery. This was built on the .NET Core web framework. The main goal of mine was to have a clean and efficent web design which allows user to easily gather information. From the front page all the information is already given, but if the user wants to learn more, they are a click away from going in depth to my reasonings.

This site is not hosted, so in order to run, it needs to be built on visual studios and go to https://localhost:5001/button
